## Bulk RNA-seq Transcriptomics Analysis Using DESeq2

This repository presents a **reproducible bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptomics analysis pipeline** implemented in **R using DESeq2**. The workflow demonstrates essential steps in bulk RNA-seq data analysis, including preprocessing of count data, sample annotation, normalization, and differential gene expression analysis between biological conditions.

The analysis generates standard transcriptomics visualizations such as **principal component analysis (PCA)**, **volcano plots**, and **heatmaps of top differentially expressed genes**, with results exported in structured tables and publication-ready figures.

This project was developed to **demonstrate hands-on R programming and transcriptomics data analysis skills**, while also serving as a clear and beginner-friendly reference workflow** that can be adapted to other bulk RNA-seq datasets.


### Dataset Source

The RNA-seq data analyzed in this project were obtained from the following publicly available study:

Lee, H. K., Knabl, L., Knabl Sr., L., Wieser, M., Mur, A., Zabernigg, A., Schumacher, J., Kapferer, S., Kaiser, N., Furth, P. A., & Hennighausen, L. (2022).  
Immune transcriptome analysis of COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the E484K escape mutation identifies a distinct gene module. Scientific Reports, 12, Article 2784.

Only a subset of samples was used for demonstration purposes. Raw sequencing files are not included in this repository.


### Notes

- This repository contains **processed data only**
- The analysis is intended for **educational and skills-demonstration purposes**
- The workflow can be readily extended to other bulk RNA-seq datasets
